# three.js.components #

Working through three.js tutorials to become fluent in programming in &Ropf;Â³. :)

## How to run ##

- Change to project directory.
- Check if three is installed:

```
npm list
```

Otherwise install three with **npm install three**, some *.json files will appear in the project directory.

- Now run the server through

```
parcel index.html
```
