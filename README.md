Working through three.js tutorials to become fluent in programming in &Ropf;Â³. :)

## How to run ##

- Check if three.js and parcel are installed:

```
npm list
```

We use parcel as a almost zero config build tool.

- Install parcel:

```
npm i parcel
```

- Install three with **npm install three**

- Ensure to add "source": "index.html" in the package.json file of your project.

- Now run the server through with a simple parcel command in your project directory:

```
parcel
```
