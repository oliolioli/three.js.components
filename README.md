# three.js.components #

Working through three.js tutorials to become fluent in programming in &Ropf;Â³. :)

Good tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjcjAqAnHd1EIxV4FSZIiJZvsdrBc1Xho

## How to run ##

- Change to project directory.
- Check if three is installed:

```
npm list
```

Otherwise install three with **npm install three**, some *.json files will appear in the project directory.

- Now run the server through

```
parcel index.html js/
```

(If you encounter problems with hotloading, then ensure to include all files as an argument: parcel index.html foo.html foo.script ...)

See: https://parceljs.org/features/cli/
