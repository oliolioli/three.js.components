Working through three.js tutorials to become fluent in programming in &Ropf;Â³. :)

## How to run ##

- Check if three.js and parcel are installed:

```
npm list
```

We use _parcel_ as a almost zero config build tool. Install parcel in your working directory:

```
npm install --save-dev parcel
```

Install _three_ with 

```
npm install three
```

- Ensure to add "source": "index.html" in the package.json file of your project.

- Now run the server through with a simple parcel command in your project directory:

```
npx parcel index.html 
```

Parcel will announce "Server running at http://localhost:1234" and will hotload all your changes immediately.

## What we need furthermore ##

[dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) - A lightweight graphical user interface for changing variables in JavaScript.

```
npm install dat.gui
```

## Further documentation ##

See: https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/ for details concerning installation and https://parceljs.org/features/cli for CLI commands.
